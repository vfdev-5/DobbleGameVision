1) Size of the input image influences :
	a) Number of detected descriptors
	b) minimal distance for good matches
	c) minimal number of good matches 



2) Provide 3 modes :

	a) Fast but the less precise 
		- extract features : 1) Hu moments, 2) 
		- match features :
	
	b) Basic, more accurate
		- extract features : AKAZE features
		- match features : FLANN matcher

	c) Complex with ML
		-- Training phase : 
		-- Detection phase :
